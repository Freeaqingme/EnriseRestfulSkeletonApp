<mtdowling> As for retrieving response time:
<mtdowling> You can use the getInfo method of the Response object
<mtdowling> this contains stuff from http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-getinfo.php
<Freeaqingme> oh, sweet
<Freeaqingme> I had 1 more question; is there any way to disable the redirects?
<mtdowling> Yes
<mtdowling> one sec
<mtdowling> Client constructors have a config array as the second argument. You can add 'redirect.disable' => true to this config array to disable redirects in Guzzle.
<Freeaqingme> awesome, tnx
<mtdowling> There's a constant for that too: Guzzle\Http\Client::DISABLE_REDIRECTS
